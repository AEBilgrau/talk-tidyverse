## Talk about the tidyverse

This is the source for the `tidyverse` presentation at the Aalborg R User Group meeting 28-jan-2019. The take-home message was that most of the content has been borrowed or strongly inspired from [tidyverse.org](https://tidyverse.org "The tidyverse homepage") and the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book.

The talk slides are available live and online
[here.](https://aalborgrug.github.io/talk-tidyverse/ "The tidyverse talk") 

### How to compile the presentation

You can clone the repo and compile the slides by running `make` or

     make slides

from your shell. Alternatively, you can open `index.Rmd` with Rstudio and press the *knit* button.

The slides were created using the [`knitr`](https://yihui.name/knitr/) and [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) packages.
